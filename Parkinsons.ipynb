Unlike typical reviews this one is a living document, a Python Jupyter notebook, that allows its results and follow-on work to be executed by the reader. It can also be used as a reference template for similar machine learning investigations.  \n","\n","This was an interesting paper for two reasons. It introduces the revolution that a degenerative disease, like Parkinson's, that plagues millions, can be telediagnosed by voiceprint. With later work it developed into an excellent comparative platform for six machine learning algorithms we will run below.  \n","\n","Three of these algorithms had higher than high 95% accuracy we will see in the Results Section below.  \n","<figure>\n","<img src='https://wdv.com/Software/AI-5383/projects/Project2/images/image01-SixResults.png' width='35%'/>\n","<figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center\"><h3>Figure 1: Results from Six Algorithms</h3></figcaption>\n","</figure>\n","\n","We will run all six of these in a moment.\n","\n","The original work, and paper published from it, only used Support Vector Machines and K-Nearest Neighbors.\n","However, it did not detail or discuss a portion of method, process and technology that enabled it to be so effective. This cleverness took place in two steps, the Speech Parsing section and the Feature Extraction section of the Data Collection flow shown here in a diagram, Figure 2, from the paper:\n","<figure>\n","<img src='https://wdv.com/Software/AI-5383/projects/Project2/images/image02-DataCollection.png' width='50%'/>\n","<figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center\"><h3>Figure 2: Data Collection in Original Paper</h3></figcaption>\n","</figure>\n","<figure>\n","<img src='https://wdv.com/Software/AI-5383/projects/Project2/images/image03-Citation.png' width='50%'/>\n","</figure>\n","\n","The speech parsing section was, a presumably manual, extraction of the sound waveforms representing specific utterances like the vowel 'o' and the word 'four' for each of the patients. The next stage feature extraction was much more significant. In order to produce and label the data provided it was necessary for them to transform the time-domain speech data into frequency-domain samples, and then label specific frequency bands in the data according that were most likely to correspond to patients who were negative and positive for the illness. The clue to this is in the waveform diagram, Figure 1 from the paper:  \n","\n","<figure>\n","<img src='https://wdv.com/Software/AI-5383/projects/Project2/images/image04-Waveforms.png' width='50%'/>\n","<figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center\"><h3>Figure 3: Non PK and PK Waveforms in Original Paper</h3></figcaption>\n","</figure>\n","<figure>\n","<img src='https://wdv.com/Software/AI-5383/projects/Project2/images/image03-Citation.png' width='50%'/>\n","</figure>\n","\n","According to the paper, 'the speech is parsed to be split into voice samples, and time-frequency based features are extracted from the voice samples using Praat acoustic analysis software.' It was this specific feature extraction that enables the algorithm to work, and it may be that that portion of the algorithm is being held back as proprietary, but the high frequencies appearing in the bottom waveform are a clue that there are a cluster of frequencies that are diagnostic for Parkinson's and this is the first place that someone trying to reproduce the full experiment would start.\n","These speech aspects are listed in the paper as telltale features of Parkinson's:\n"," - dysphonia (defective use of the voice),\n"," - hypophonia (reduced volume),\n"," - monotone (reduced pitch range),\n"," - dysarthria (difficulty with articulation of sounds or syllables)\n","Three of the four are frequency domain attributes and hypophonia is a time domain attribute that can also be acquired by the amplitude of the frequency domain bin contents. Here is a list of the features extracted in the paper, and this list is quickly examined by plotting a series of histograms from the supplied data to confirm plausible trends.  \n","  \n","<figure>\n","<img src='https://wdv.com/Software/AI-5383/projects/Project2/images/image05-Features.png' width='50%'/>\n","<figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center\"><h3>Figure 3: Features Extracted Original Paper</h3></figcaption>\n","</figure>\n","<figure>\n","<img src='https://wdv.com/Software/AI-5383/projects/Project2/images/image03-Citation.png' width='50%'/>\n","</figure>   \n","\n","The data collected in the context of this study for the original study included:\n","\n"," - 20 PWP (6 female, 14 male) and\n"," - 20 healthy individuals (10 female, 10 male)  \n","\n","who appealed at the Department of Neurology in Cerrahpaşa School of Medicine, Istanbul University\n","Test group consists of patients who are suffering from PD for 0 to 6 years.\n","\n","But inspection of the dataset showed that this number had grown from 40 subjects to 195. It is worth noting that in the larger dataset there are about 140 positive patients and 45 negative patients, so the data is unbalanced in that respect. This is noted in the code as well, and be computed exactly if desired. I did not have time to trace the pedigree of the additional data used in the analysis below, but it could be one reason that the accuracy went from 79% and 82% for k-NN and SVM with 40 subjects to 98% and 90% in the 195-subject case.\n","\n","The Classification methods include:\n","\n"," - Classification with Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO)\n"," - Classification with Summarized Leave-One-Out (s-LOO)\n","\n","Evaluation Metrics:\n","The evaluation metrics are repeated from the paper because they are the bread-and-butter formulas of data science and it never hurts to review them. It also gives the author a chance to practice inserting LaTeX math formulas in Jupyter notebooks and getting them formatted correcly. The figures of merit for classifiers are:\n","\n"," - Accuracy\n"," - Sensitivity\n"," - Specificity\n"," - MCC\n","\n","Accuracy is the ratio of correctly classified instances to all instances:  \n","  \n","$$\n","accuracy = \\frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}  \n","$$\n","  \n","Where:\n"," - TP true positives\n"," - TN true negatives\n"," - FP false positives\n"," - FN false negatives  \n","\n","Sensitivity and specificity are statistical measures of correctly classified positive and negative instances, respectively:\n","  \n","$$\n","sensitivity = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN}  \n","$$\n","  \n","$$\n","specificity = \\frac{TN}{TN + FP}  \n","$$\n","\n","The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) plots sensitivity vs. 1-specificity, but we will label the axes as TP vs. TN for brevity.

It is stable even if the class densities are considerably different. MCC is a correlation coefficient between the predicted and observed binary classifications and gets a value between –1 and +1.
